# Topic 101: System Architecture

#### Hardware Configuration

In this section, you will learn about different hardware components that make up a Linux system, such as the CPU, RAM, hard drives, and peripherals. Understanding hardware settings, configurations, and compatibility is crucial for ensuring optimal system performance and stability.

#### Boot Processes

This subsection focuses on the boot process of a Linux system. It covers the stages involved, including the BIOS or UEFI initialization, bootloader execution (such as GRUB), loading the kernel into memory, and the initial RAM disk (initrd/initramfs). You will explore the role of each stage and the interactions between them during system startup.

#### System Initialization

Once the boot process is complete, the system proceeds with the initialization phase. This part explains the initialization systems used in Linux, such as SysV init or newer alternatives like systemd. You will learn about runlevels, init scripts, and how system services are started and managed during boot and runtime.
